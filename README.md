# Flight_Status_Prediction
In this project, we intend to use data analytics to find the correlation existent between flight delays (specific to 2022's USA flight data) and multiple factors, especially during high season for travelling, where there is an increased demand for flight booking. <br>
We also used a machine learning algorithm that uses classification to better understand and predict which flights are going to be delayed, based on date and time metrics and route stats.
<br>
<br>
Our goal is to prove the existence and analyze the impact of the increase on demand for flights during high season timeframes of the year.

This is a repository dedicated to the conjoined efforts of documenting our experiments on the topic and subsequent composition of the article <a>soon to be linked here <a>.
It is originally part of the Introduction to Data Science course, ministered by Prof. Luciano Barbosa, and later adapted to be part of the Technical-scientific Communication course, ministered by Prof. Caio de Souza, both from the Federal University of Pernambuco (CIn - UFPE).
